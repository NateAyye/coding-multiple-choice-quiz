[Deployed Site HERE!!!](https://nateayye.github.io/coding-multiple-choice-quiz/)

## Description

A dynamic Quiz made with HTML CSS and mainly Javascript. Here is an example of what a coding quiz may look like from a interviewees point of view. so I have now familiarized my self a bit more with how that all works:

- To get a working Coding Quiz that can challenge you and one that can also keep track of the scores that were gotten with our newly learned localStorage
- This was a good practice project to get an idea of what kind of coding I might be doing when I want to change the HTML of the page.

## Installation

Clone or fork the repository from the Github repository onto your local system and then with the editor of your choosing you can run the index.html file in the root directory in your browser with your prefered extension.

## Usage

When you first open the Page you will be greated with a Start Page with a short description of the quiz and a few other things including a timer, highscores link and a start button.

Once The start button is clicked it will automaticly bring you to the first question.
And it will start counting down the timer.

Once the question is answered you will be moved on to the next question.
Keep in mind points will be lost for more time taken and for wrong answers
